Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Here are some of the main features:

Headers: You can create a header by using the # symbol. The number of # you use will determine the size of the header. For example, # Header 1, ## Header 2, ### Header 3, and so on.

Emphasis: You can make text bold using ** or __ around the text, and italic using * or _ around the text. For example, **bold text**, *italic text*.

Lists: You can create ordered and unordered lists using numbers and - or *. For example:

item
Links: You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). For example, [GitHub](http://github.com).

Images: Similar to links, but add an exclamation mark ! before the brackets. For example, ![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png).

Code and Syntax Highlighting: You can use backticks `` to denote code. For example, `code`. For blocks of code, you can use triple backticks and optionally specify the language for syntax highlighting.

Tables: You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |.

Blockquotes: You can indicate blockquotes with a >.

Horizontal Rules: You can create a horizontal rule with three or more hyphens ---, asterisks ***, or underscores ___.

Inline HTML: Markdown supports a subset of HTML, so you can use HTML tags for more complex formatting.

Escaping: You can use the backslash \ to escape special characters and treat them as literal characters.

Remember, not all markdown features are available in all markdown processors. Always check the documentation of the specific processor you are using.
